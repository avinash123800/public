[narrator]:<i> Then.</i>

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:45.078 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.520 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:18%
<i> Later.</i>

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:56.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

<i> This is not a movie.</i>

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:22.081 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:78%
Robbery suspect, Joseph Flores,

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:28.154 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:78%
But the law caught up with him.

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:49.676 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%

<i> Flores and his girlfriend</i>

<i> Including a cop.</i>

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:56.683 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:73%
The sergeant came on and said

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:59.853 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:60%
shots fired, and that he
had been hit.

<i> A potential death sentence</i>
<i> for neighborhood children.</i>

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.551 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:73%
I passed a kid on his bicycle
on the sidewalk.

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:73%
And that was a reality check.

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.889 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:73%
It's kinda like,
"Hey, remember where we are."

[music]

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:42.495 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:78%

<i> the chase takes a deadly turn.</i>

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:44.364 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:78%
The girlfriend fires on Waller.

[gunshots]

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:50.904 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
She actually reached out
the passenger window, and aimed.

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:52.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
[gunshots]

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.541 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:58%
[Mike]: And fired three
or four rounds.

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.175 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:53%
[police]:<i> Shots fired</i>
<i> out the window!</i>

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:57.410 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
They were obviously,
you know,

00:02:57.577 --> 00:03:00.747 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:53%
would be cop killers.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.583 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:73%
[narrator]:<i> Waller acts fast.</i>
<i> With one hand on the wheel,</i>

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.387 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
<i> he grabs an assault rifle</i>
<i> from under his dash...</i>

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.888 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:28%
<i> And fires.</i>

[gunshots]

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:14.594 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:58%
[Mike]: I think I fired
12 rounds.

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:16.029 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:73%
Through the cab of the truck.

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
[gunshots]

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:23.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And then they really took off.

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:25.605 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:68%
[narrator]:<i> Flores has only</i>
<i> one chance to escape...</i>

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:29.075 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
<i> The open highway.</i>

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.777 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
[Mike]: They were headed
towards the freeway.

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:32.445 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:68%
Somethin' just told me that
that's where

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:34.113 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:58%
he was gonna try to go.

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:38.518 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
[narrator]:<i> Waller is determined</i>
<i> not to let it get that far.</i>

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:40.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
I took out a tire.

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:43.056 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
He was not gonna be able to
maintain control of the vehicle.

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:46.593 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:78%
[narrator]:<i> Waller unloads</i>
<i> another round of lethal force.</i>

[gunshots]

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.398 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:73%
[narrator]:<i> Eight bullets</i>
<i> tear into the truck's tires.</i>

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:55.134 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
<i> But still, the suspects</i>
<i> thunder onto the highway.</i>

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:01.474 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:58%
[Mike]: I knew this guy
wasn't gonna last long.

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:02.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
We continued southbound,

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.745 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:58%
I saw that the tire had
started to come apart.

00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:07.814 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:53%
We started to come up
into some traffic,

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:09.649 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
and he started fish-tailin'.

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.660 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:48%
[Mike]: He lost it.

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:23.262 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Came around one vehicle,
totally, from the rear

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:24.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
all the way around to the front.

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:26.733 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:53%
And there was a black
pickup truck that was

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:29.469 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
driving southbound also,
that when he fish-tailed around,

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:30.903 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
he can't...
He hit that truck.

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:32.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Spun that black truck out,

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:36.309 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:48%
and he continued on
to hit the wall.

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:39.846 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:58%
[narrator]:<i> Incredibly,</i>
<i> Flores bails out.</i>

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.649 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
<i> Taking a blind leap</i>

<i> 20 feet straight down.</i>

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.858 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
<i> But Waller's first concern</i>
is the trigger-happy girlfriend.

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:53.860 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
[Mike]: I told her,
"Don't even think about it."

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:56.129 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:58%
Because it would be
the last thing she did.

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.298 align:middle line:79% position:49% size:78%
[narrator]:<i> Only now</i>
can police turn their attention

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:01.034 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
-<i> back to Flores.</i>
<i> - We had a visual on him.</i>

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.704 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:58%
I mean, from the minute
he exited the vehicle.

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:07.006 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:48%
[narrator]:<i> History</i>
