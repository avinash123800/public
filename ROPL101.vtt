out something.

01:15:50.779 --> 01:15:54.383 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
Looks like I got a male over
here in the grass, passed out.

01:15:58.587 --> 01:16:00.255 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
-I don't know
if he's okay or not.

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:02.124 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:78%
-Alright, I'll check on him.
-If he's just sleeping or what?

01:16:02.124 --> 01:16:03.792 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:68%
I don't want to go up there
because I'm by myself.

01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:07.963 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:78%
-I got you. We'll check on him.
-Okay, thank you.

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:11.967 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:20%
Nye-8.
<i> -Nye-8?</i>

01:16:11.967 --> 01:16:15.270 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:43%
-Out with a male.

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:16.738 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
Don't know if he's unconscious

01:16:16.738 --> 01:16:19.508 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:80%
or if he's just sleeping
on the grass next to the church.

01:16:19.508 --> 01:16:21.677 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:35%
White T-shirt.
Brown pants.

01:16:23.312 --> 01:16:25.414 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:18%
<i> -Copy.</i>

01:16:40.829 --> 01:16:42.798 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:53%
-It's the guy from --
I should...

01:16:47.502 --> 01:16:52.507 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:63%
What are you doing, John?
You alright?

01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:53.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Well, this lady was strolling by

01:16:53.909 --> 01:16:55.644 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:63%
and was worried about
you sleeping on the grass

01:16:55.644 --> 01:16:58.747 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
why are you or sleeping on the
grass of the church, man?

01:16:58.747 --> 01:17:01.650 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:38%
-Just a rest.
-Taking a rest?

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:03.352 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:58%
-Why, is that an issue?

01:17:03.352 --> 01:17:07.189 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-Well, it's private property.
And she was worried about you.

01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:09.124 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:23%
-You are?
-Correct.

01:17:09.124 --> 01:17:12.527 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:73%
-Since when?
-Since I was eight years old.

01:17:15.597 --> 01:17:18.767 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:73%
-Since what?
-Since I was eight years old.

01:17:22.838 --> 01:17:25.540 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
-It doesn't mean you can
just sleep on their grass.

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:29.044 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:63%
-I was just taking a rest
that's all.

01:17:29.044 --> 01:17:30.479 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
-So what you're telling me
is you're going to be

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:31.880 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:43%
moving on, right?
-Yep.

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.349 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:73%
-Quit digging in your pockets
till I'm done.

01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:36.752 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I'm done talking with you.
-Alright.

01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:43.225 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
-So if I call them,
they're going to be okay

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:45.127 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:53%
with you laying here?

01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:46.762 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:63%
I don't remember you ever
attending this church.

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:48.597 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Do you do it in this church?
-I did.

01:17:48.597 --> 01:17:53.068 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:73%
I was baptized in this church
when I was eight.

01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:55.404 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:48%
[Indistinct speech]

01:17:55.404 --> 01:17:58.907 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
-Let me ask you a question, man.
How long have I known you?

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:03.512 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:60%
-For a long time. Right.
-Yeah.

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:06.581 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
-What made you why are you
going this route?

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:11.453 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:58%
-What route am I going?
-The homeless route.

01:18:11.453 --> 01:18:12.954 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:60%
You know,
you're comfortable, too.

01:18:12.954 --> 01:18:16.191 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
I know, but you're better than
that, you know that.

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:18.193 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:63%
-Doesn't make --
-My kids, my kids grew up

01:18:18.193 --> 01:18:22.798 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:80%
with you guys and -- Why are you
choosing this, though?

01:18:22.798 --> 01:18:25.801 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
-It's just something
I have to do.

01:18:25.801 --> 01:18:27.769 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:73%
-What do you mean you have --
-Obviously he's known them

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:29.504 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:55%
for a long time there.

01:18:29.504 --> 01:18:32.040 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:68%
Trying to give some advice.

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.076 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:63%
In the meantime, let's go
to Richland County.

01:18:34.076 --> 01:18:38.113 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
Captain Danny Brown there,
pulling over a vehicle.

01:18:38.113 --> 01:18:40.382 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:55%
Looks like for running
a red light an.

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:42.117 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:55%
-...miles an hour, so.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.788 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:48%
Connecticut plates.

01:18:46.788 --> 01:18:48.390 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:63%
I was getting ready to go
through that light

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:49.958 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:73%
and he come right through it.

01:18:49.958 --> 01:18:53.095 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
Let's see why he's driving
and not paying attention.

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:07.576 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
How are you doing, ma'am?
Do you not see that red light?

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:09.111 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:28%
-I did not.
-Didn't?

01:19:09.111 --> 01:19:11.012 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:58%
-I totally didn't.
-I was getting ready to

01:19:11.012 --> 01:19:13.782 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:78%
come through my green light and
you came right in front of us.

01:19:13.782 --> 01:19:16.384 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:63%
-I'm sorry. Oh, I didn't.
I'm not eating from here.

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:18.186 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
-Okay? You get your driver's
license today, ma'am?

01:19:18.186 --> 01:19:20.255 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
-You're lost? Where y'all
trying to get to? It's okay.

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:21.756 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
-I got to reach right here
in my bag.

01:19:21.756 --> 01:19:23.759 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
-Okay. Alright.
No weapons in there.

01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:25.994 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
-No.
-Okay. No, no, no.

01:19:25.994 --> 01:19:27.829 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:33%
I was just --
We ask.

01:19:29.965 --> 01:19:32.601 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
Oh, hey. Just some little ones
in the back?

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:34.136 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:15%
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:19:37.272 --> 01:19:39.174 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:73%
Yeah, you were doing about 35
when you went through

01:19:39.174 --> 01:19:40.742 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:68%
that red light right there,
ma'am?

01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:43.311 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
-Yeah, I did not.
-Ooh. Luckily, I looked over

01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:46.047 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
because we would have met.
-Yeah, and, I'm so sorry.

01:19:46.047 --> 01:19:48.316 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
I did not
-Y'all just down visiting.

01:19:48.316 --> 01:19:49.918 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:38%
-Yeah.
-Okay. Alright.

01:19:49.918 --> 01:19:52.120 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:73%
-Just got in town.
-How long you're in town for?

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.622 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:48%
For a little while?
-Just today.

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:55.457 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
-Okay.
-Well, you all please be safe.

01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:57.058 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:68%
Make sure you pay attention
for the red lights. Okay?

01:19:57.058 --> 01:19:58.727 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:63%
-Thank you. I'm so sorry.
-Alright.

01:19:58.727 --> 01:19:59.828 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:60%
Colombia's a cool place.
everybody likes to

01:19:59.828 --> 01:20:01.196 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:53%
see everything but...

01:20:01.196 --> 01:20:03.765 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:55%
-Alright. We will keep
a close eye on that.

01:20:03.765 --> 01:20:06.501 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:63%
But right now, we want to
bring in an old friend

01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:07.869 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:60%
from the National Center
for Missing

01:20:07.869 --> 01:20:10.438 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:58%
and Exploited Children,
Angeline Hartmann.

01:20:10.438 --> 01:20:14.743 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:78%
Angeline, it has been too long.
Great to see you.

01:20:14.743 --> 01:20:15.911 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:58%
-Great to see you guys.

01:20:15.911 --> 01:20:18.213 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:43%
Congratulations
on this new show.

01:20:18.213 --> 01:20:21.650 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:80%
This is so awesome for everybody
all the way around.

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:23.185 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
I'm so happy to be here.
-Alright.

01:20:23.185 --> 01:20:26.488 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
Now let's get to tonight's case.
Curtis, what do we got.

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:28.089 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:63%
-Uh, Opie Nation tonight.

01:20:28.089 --> 01:20:30.826 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:80%
We really need your help to find
a missing Kentucky teenager.

01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:33.395 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:40%
On May 26, 2021,
Kamaria Johnson,

01:20:33.395 --> 01:20:35.997 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:60%
She vanished from a home
in Radcliff, Kentucky,

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:37.899 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:68%
just outside of Louisville.

01:20:37.899 --> 01:20:39.434 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:58%
Angeline, what were the
circumstances

01:20:39.434 --> 01:20:41.903 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:78%
behind Kamaria's disappearance?

01:20:41.903 --> 01:20:44.940 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:80%
Well, Curtis, Kamaria apparently
had a disagreement

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:47.075 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:63%
with her family
the night she disappeared

01:20:47.075 --> 01:20:48.910 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:68%
and she took off
in the middle of the night.

01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:51.713 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
She had no cell phone.
She had no money,

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:54.082 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
and she didn't even take
her glasses with her.

01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:57.018 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:78%
After that, nobody really knows
what happened.

01:20:57.018 --> 01:20:58.987 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:68%
-I understand investigators
got a really good lead

01:20:58.987 --> 01:21:00.555 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:73%
right after she went missing.

01:21:00.555 --> 01:21:04.025 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:68%
-Right. So what happened is
later on that day,

01:21:04.025 --> 01:21:08.830 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
somebody came forward and said
they gave Kamaria a ride

01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:12.467 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to a convenience store
in the neighboring county,

01:21:12.467 --> 01:21:16.037 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and they didn't realize it was
Kamaria until later that day.

01:21:16.037 --> 01:21:18.039 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:63%
So they go
and they tell the family.

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:20.041 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:73%
Police follow up on that lead

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:21.977 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
and they find
the surveillance footage

01:21:21.977 --> 01:21:24.980 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:73%
and they can see Kamaria
in that surveillance footage.

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:26.915 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:48%
They see her coming
into the store

01:21:26.915 --> 01:21:29.784 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
and they see her leave
that store.

01:21:29.784 --> 01:21:32.153 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
But that's where
the trail goes cold.

01:21:32.153 --> 01:21:35.790 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:80%
-Angeline, have you had a chance
to talk to our family?

01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:37.959 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:63%
-I have.
I talked to her mom today

01:21:37.959 --> 01:21:40.295 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
and basically she stressed

01:21:40.295 --> 01:21:43.331 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:73%
that this is not like Kamaria
to disappear.

01:21:43.331 --> 01:21:47.669 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
She is a straight-A student.
She is in color guard.

01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:49.137 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:78%
She's very close to her family.

01:21:49.137 --> 01:21:52.474 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
And it's really puzzling
and very upsetting to everybody.

01:21:52.474 --> 01:21:55.143 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
-Alright. Now let's take
another look at Kamaria.

01:21:55.143 --> 01:21:59.014 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:73%
She's black, 17 years of age,
5'5", 155 pounds.

01:21:59.014 --> 01:22:00.815 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:68%
And when she was last seen,

01:22:00.815 --> 01:22:02.484 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
she had braids on.
But one more note.

01:22:02.484 --> 01:22:05.153 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:68%
She normally wears glasses,
but when she left home,

01:22:05.153 --> 01:22:08.356 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:78%
she did not take them with her.
If you know where she is

01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:10.358 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:60%
or have any information
about her disappearance,

01:22:10.358 --> 01:22:12.594 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:78%
please call the National Center
for Missing

a blood sample

technique to use spike strips.

02:07:39.151 --> 02:07:42.654 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:78%
-No, sir, actually,
I'm on my way up to Birmingham.

02:07:42.654 --> 02:07:45.691 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:38%
-To Birmingham?
On foot?

02:07:45.691 --> 02:07:48.093 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:68%
-Yeah.
-That's a long walk, buddy.

02:07:48.093 --> 02:07:49.495 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:58%
-Do what you got to do.

02:07:49.495 --> 02:07:51.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
-Yeah. Where are you from?

02:07:51.697 --> 02:07:53.265 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:58%
-I'm out of Birmingham.

02:07:53.265 --> 02:07:54.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
-You got a Florida
driver's license

02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:56.035 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:68%
and you're from Birmingham?

02:07:56.035 --> 02:07:58.637 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
-No, originally here
from Alabama.

02:07:58.637 --> 02:08:00.472 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:28%
I'm here --

02:08:00.472 --> 02:08:03.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Originally from Alabama.

02:08:03.342 --> 02:08:06.178 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
-Okay. You need medics
or anything, man?

02:08:06.178 --> 02:08:08.113 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
-Sir?
-Said do you need medics

02:08:08.113 --> 02:08:09.615 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
or anything?
-No, no, no, no, no.

02:08:09.615 --> 02:08:12.284 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
-You're just sleeping?
-Yeah, man, I'm good.

02:08:12.284 --> 02:08:14.853 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:53%
-Okay.
You're from Lakeland?

02:08:14.853 --> 02:08:18.757 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:73%
-No. Well, I mean, yeah, I've
been there for about a year.

02:08:18.757 --> 02:08:21.493 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:78%
-Okay, so is that where you
started your trek to Birmingham

02:08:21.493 --> 02:08:23.629 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:33%
was Lakeland?
-Yeah.

02:08:23.629 --> 02:08:26.098 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
-Yes or no? You seem kind of
on the fence about that.

02:08:26.098 --> 02:08:28.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:08:28.934 --> 02:08:32.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Thing is, I got, um...

02:08:32.871 --> 02:08:35.674 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:48%
I got kicked out...

02:08:35.674 --> 02:08:39.778 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:73%
-Alright, let's go to Volusia
County to Deputy Wes Brough.

02:08:39.778 --> 02:08:42.281 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
He's backing up
on a traffic stop.

02:08:50.055 --> 02:08:54.093 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:78%
-And when she opened
the glove box to get their IDs,

02:08:54.093 --> 02:08:56.462 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
you could see a pipe laying.

02:08:56.462 --> 02:08:57.763 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:15%
-Okay.

02:08:57.763 --> 02:08:59.731 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
-[ Speaking indistinctly ]

02:08:59.731 --> 02:09:02.901 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:78%
-Alright, we'll pull them out
and start searching them, then.

02:09:02.901 --> 02:09:04.403 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:43%
You said it was
in the glove box?

02:09:04.403 --> 02:09:07.272 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:68%
-I'm sorry, center console.
-Center console? Okay.

02:09:08.707 --> 02:09:11.043 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
-[ Speaking indistinctly ]

02:09:15.214 --> 02:09:17.516 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:68%
-He's in the driver's seat?
-Yeah.

02:09:17.516 --> 02:09:18.550 align:middle line:85% position:51% size:23%
-Alright.

02:09:18.550 --> 02:09:20.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
-[ Speaking indistinctly ]

02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:30.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
-Alright. We did it.

02:09:30.395 --> 02:09:32.431 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:43%
For Sean Larkin
and Curtis Wilson

02:09:32.431 --> 02:09:35.134 align:middle line:79% position:51% size:53%
and everyone here
at "On Patrol: Live,"

02:09:35.134 --> 02:09:38.570 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
thank you for watching
our inaugural episode.

02:09:38.570 --> 02:09:41.673 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
So sorry about all those
technical problems we had.

02:09:41.673 --> 02:09:43.475 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:78%
We think we've sorted them out.

02:09:43.475 --> 02:09:45.911 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:63%
We're confident we're not
going to have them again.

02:09:45.911 --> 02:09:47.646 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:63%
And we're looking forward
to seeing you here

02:09:47.646 --> 02:09:50.315 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
again tomorrow night

02:09:50.315 --> 02:09:54.987 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
for another three-hour edition
of "On Patrol: Live."

02:09:54.987 --> 02:09:56.488 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:33%
See you then.

02:10:14.039 --> 02:10:15.407 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:60%
Clear we don't even know

02:10:15.407 --> 02:10:17.509 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:55%
if there was any crime
committed here.

02:10:17.509 --> 02:10:20.813 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
-When they went
to grab their IDs,

02:10:20.813 --> 02:10:25.050 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
what looks like a weed pipe
was right there in plain view.

02:10:25.050 --> 02:10:27.920 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:55%
So we're just going to
go through it,

02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:30.923 align:middle line:10% position:51% size:78%
make sure there's nothing else.
